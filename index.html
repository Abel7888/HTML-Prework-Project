                <h1>Basketball</h1>
                <strong><small>The History of Basketball</small></strong>
                <p>Basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less 
                    injury-prone sport than football. Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes 
                    indoors during the winters. The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, 
                    first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges, the professional 
                    game followed. The American National Basketball Association (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise by 
                    the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture.</p>

                <strong><small>The History Of Soccer</small></strong>
                <p>More than 240 million people around the world play soccer regularly according to the Federation Internationale de Football 
                    Association (FIFA). The game has evolved from the sport of kicking a rudimentary animal-hide ball around into the World Cup 
                    sport it is today.

                    Records trace the history of soccer back more than 2,000 years ago to ancient China. Greece, Rome, and parts of Central America
                     also claim to have started the sport; but it was England that transitioned soccer, or what the British and many other people around
                      the world call “football,” into the game we know today. The English are credited with recording the first uniform rules for the 
                      sport, including forbidding tripping opponents and touching the ball with hands.</p>

                <h1>Baseball</h1>
                <strong><small>A brif history of baseball</small></strong>
                <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. 
                    The game is live when the umpire signals to the pitcher either verbally or by pointing, indicating that the ball is
                     now in play. A player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team tries 
                     to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away 
                     from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around 
                     four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) 
                     is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored 
                     when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started 
                     as a batter).</p>

        <h1>Abel Assefa Favorit Sport</h1>
            <strong><small>The values of sports</small></strong>
            <p>Currently, my favorite sports are basketball and boxing. I grew up playing basketball and boxing is great for cardio. 
                I played organized basketball growing up. Sports teach you integrity, respect, responsibility, sportsmanship, and 
                servant leadership.  Physical activity has been shown to stimulate chemicals in the brain that make you feel better. 
                So playing sport regularly improves children's overall emotional well-being. Research shows there's a link between playing 
                sport and self-esteem
